# isYourBirthdayLucky

### About

This is a web application created using Vanilla JS.
It works by getting two inputs from the client (i.e: DOB and Lucky number) and it checks whether the client DOB is lucky or not.

### Logic
If the sum of all numbers in the DOB of client is divisible by their lucky Number , then DOB is lucky else not lucky
